Project Title : AYUSH Startup Portal
Description : Weâ€™re looking for a solution by creating a web-based application that will serves as a platform for entrepreneurs to connect with each other and the government for promoting the Indian medical culture                AYUSH(Ayurveda, Yoga & Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, Sowa Rigpa and Homoeopathy).

What we do till today ?
  We create the basic prototype of the Project in which we made some page (Home page, Vision, Contact, About, Login as USER and ADMIN, Registeration page) only for our demo purpose.
  In future we add more functionality as we upgrade our project to a mass user accessibility.
