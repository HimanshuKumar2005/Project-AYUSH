*Project Title : AYUSH Startup Portal

*Description : Weâ€™re looking for a solution by creating a web-based application that will serves as a platform for entrepreneurs to connect with each other and the government for promoting the Indian medical culture AYUSH(Ayurveda, Yoga & Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, Sowa Rigpa and Homoeopathy).

*What we have done until today ?
  
  We create the basic prototype of the Project in which we made some page (Home page, Vision, Contact, About, Login as USER and ADMIN, Registeration page) only for our demo purpose.
  In future we add more functionality as we upgrade our project to:
  1. Mass user accessibility
  2. Responsive websites
  3. Document validation with the help of ML
  4. Chatbot for support
  5. Enterprenuers connect with each other chat features.
  6. Goverment Loan features
  7. 17 Different languages support
  8. Area wise distribution of startups based on the AYUSH
  9. Map view to understand quickly
  10. Link the database with Ministry Of Ayush

      and many uncountable features to provide the streamlined Registration process for users...
