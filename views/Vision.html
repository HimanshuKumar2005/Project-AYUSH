      <h2>All About Us</h2>
      <p>
        The Ministry of Ayush was formed on the 9th of November 2014 with a vision of reviving the profound knowledge of our ancient systems of medicine and ensuring the optimal development and propagation of the Ayush systems of healthcare.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Startup AYUSH Portal is a unique online platform under the Ministry of Ayush designed for all stakeholders within India’s startup ecosystem. Specifically, it serves as a hub for AYUSH (Ayurveda, Yoga & Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, and Homeopathy) startups. Governed by the Indian government, this portal aims to identify, support, and promote innovations and startups in the AYUSH sector.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through collaboration with institutions like the All India Institute of Ayurveda (AIIA), it fosters research, development, and technology adoption, accelerating the growth of AYUSH practices across the country.
